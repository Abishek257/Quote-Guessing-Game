Quote Guessing Game using Web Scraping in Python

  Developed the Quote Guessing game using Web Scraping in Python. We will scrape a quote and details of the author from this site "https://quotes.toscrape.com/" using python framework called BeautifulSoup and develop a guessing game where the user need to guess the Author name for the given quote by using the hints given. Totally, the user have 4 guesses and in each guess we get the hint to find the author name. If user finds the correct author name at any guess, it will return the message "Success". If the user is unable to find the author name after all the 4 guesses, it will return the message "Failure" along with the author name.
